 The hare and the Tortoise
Once there lived a hare who was always proud of his speed in running. One day a Tortoise challenged him for a race. After 1 week of training for the
race, the day for the race had finallly come. When the race started, the hare ran as fast as he could and stopped at a tree to rest for a while, thinking tht the Tortoise
would not be able to make it there. In a while the tortoise passed the hare and won the race. by the time the hare woke up the tortoise had already won
 the race.. The hare now understood his lesson and congratulated the tortoise.
